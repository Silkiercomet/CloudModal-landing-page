## My process

firstly i created the html template of the page using the BEM namimg convention i created a well defined (semantic) intuitive and readeable foundation to start adding the cascading style, which was created from the mobile fist workflow making the develop of the bigger screens later an easier job, after it the javascript for the sliders and the fade in animation and funcionalitie of an accordion was also added in the creation of the script.js file

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- BEM naming convention
- Intersection Observer API



### Continued development

Theres a lot to inprove mainly in the script file, both slider could have easily used the same querySelector so the functionalitie of both would have been defined in a single instance of the drag function, but for a matter of time i just copied the code two times, yes against the dry principle, so that can be done to better the perfomance of the page

also the mobile menu doest have a good use because the only option that de navbar offers is the log in one, which can be offer with a single button instead of the hamburguer menu
